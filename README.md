# Valentine Proposal

Welcome to my valentine-proposal project!
In this project I take advantage of the arrival of Valentine's Day to create a page where I can share this project with my friends and they send it to their valentines.

## Goal
- Learn how to use the Google Analytics tool to understand user behavior, to personalize the user experience (UX);
- Based on Google Analytics data, I can customize the UX in the Django project (functionalities to suit users' preferences and behaviors);
- Add access control logic on the server side (the project can only be opened on x day at a given time) with Django. 

## Technologies
